Who is using Tinkerbell?
====================

Sharing experiences and learning from other users is essential. We are
frequently asked who is using Tinkerbell in some fashion. so people can get in
contact with other users to share experiences and best practices. People
also often want to know if product/platform X has integrated Tinkerbell.
While the Tinkerbell Slack community allows
users to get in touch, it can be challenging to find this information quickly.

The following is a directory of adopters to help identify users of individual
features. The users themselves directly maintain the list.

* There is no minimum deployment size but we request to list permanent
