# Are you using Tinkerbell?

Sharing experiences and learning from other users is essential. We are
frequently asked who is using Tinkerbell in some fashion. so people can get in
contact with other users to share experiences and best practices. People
also often want to know if product/platform X has integrated Tinkerbell.
While the Tinkerbell Slack community allows
users to get in touch, it can be challenging to find this information quickly.

The following is a directory of adopters to help identify users of individual
features. The users themselves directly maintain the list.

## Adding yourself (company) as an adopter

If you are using Tinkerbell or it is integrated into your product, service, or
platform, please consider adding yourself (company) as an adopter. Open a pull request
with you or your company's info and a description of your use case.
If you are open to others contacting you about your use of Tinkerbell, add a way for folks
to get in touch with you. A good place to interact with others is in the [CNCF Slack (Tinkerbell Channel)](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/D038VL51XMZ).

    N: Name of user (company)
    D: Description of the user (company)
    U: Usage of Tinkerbell
    L: Link(s) with further information (optional)

## Requirements to be listed

* You must represent the user (company) listed. Do *NOT* add entries on behalf of other users.
* There is no minimum deployment size but we request to list permanent
  production deployments only, i.e., no demo or trial deployments. Company
  use is not required. A well-done home lab setup can be as equally
  interesting as a large-scale company deployment.
